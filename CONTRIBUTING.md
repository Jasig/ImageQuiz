# Contributing to ImageQuiz

## Semantic versioning

This project practices Semantic Versioning.

APIs for this purpose are

+ The formats of content and configuration files.

and are not

+ Java classes, interfaces.

That is, if an instructor has to change quiz, image, or configuration files to upgrade from one version to another, that's a breaking change.
